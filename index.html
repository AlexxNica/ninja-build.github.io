<h1>Ninja</h1>

<div id=content>
<p>Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed.  It differs
from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have
its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is
designed to run builds as fast as possible.</p>

<h2>Why yet another build system?</h2>

<p>Where other build systems are high-level languages Ninja aims to be
an assembler.</p>

<p>Ninja build files are human-readable but not especially convenient
to write by hand.  (See
the <a href="build.ninja.html"><em>generated</em>
build file used to build Ninja itself</a>.)  These constrained build
files allow Ninja to evaluate incremental builds quickly.</p>

<h2>Should you use Ninja?</h2>

<p>Ninja's low-level approach makes it perfect for embedding into more
featureful build systems; see <a
href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/List-of-generators-producing-ninja-build-files">a
list of existing tools</a>.  Ninja is used to build Google Chrome,
parts of Android, LLVM, and can be used in many other projects due to
CMake's Ninja backend.</p>

<p>See <a href="manual.html">the manual for more</a>: philosophical
background, whether and how you can use Ninja for your project,
platform support, and details about the language semantics.</p>

<h2>What's new</h2>

<p>The last Ninja release is <b>v1.6.0</b>, released 29 June 2015.
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/ninja-build/ISw6DWVjXLI/discussion">Read the release notes</a>.

<h2>Getting Ninja</h2>

<p>You can find Ninja binaries in your system's package manager or
download one built by the Ninja developers; see <a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages">this
list of command lines and URLs</a>.</p>

<p>Or, build from source:<br>
<pre>$ git clone git://github.com/ninja-build/ninja.git && cd ninja
$ git checkout release
$ cat README</pre></p>
